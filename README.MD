## Customer Churn Prediction & Regression using Deep Learning

Built a deep learning model to predict whether a customer will exit the bank, based on features like age, credit score, gender, salary, balance, and account activity.
Developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for binary classification using TensorFlow and Keras.
Utilized TensorBoard for real-time visualization of training metrics including loss and accuracy.
Deployed the trained model through an interactive Streamlit web application for live predictions.
Additionally developed a regression ANN model to predict a customer's estimated salary based on relevant input features.
